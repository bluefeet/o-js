JavaScript utility belt for rich objects and prototypes. Ooooh!

## Custom Builds

Custom builds of o.js, containing only the features you need, can be created easily by cloning the o-js repo, getting your environment setup (see Developer Setup below), and using the `bin/combine` tool like this:

    bin/combine --require=Type,augment 

The above would include the `Type` and `augment` modules, and their dependencies.  You could then run `grunt minify` to produce a `o.min.js` ready for your use.

Make sure that you know which version of o.js you are creating a build of.  If you've just cloned the o-js repo then you are on the master branch with all the latest development work, which could very well be broken.  To get yourself pointed at a particular release version you'll want to reset to whatever version you'd like your custom build based on.  For example:

    git reset --hard v0.0.10

Then when you run `bin/combine` you'll be using the code from that version.

## Contributing

Changes to o.js must be minimal and deliberate.  Currently the focus is contradictory - add helpful features, increase browser/platform support, and reduce the minified size.

If you've found a bug and have the tuits to fix it, then please do.  If you've got an idea for something new and shiny then a good way to start is to first [open a ticket](https://github.com/bluefeet/o-js/issues) and start a discussion.

The typical way to contribute changes to o.js is by forking the GitHub repository and sending me (Aran Deltac) a pull request in GitHub.  I'll review the pull request and ask for any changes that I think are necessary and then accept it if all is well.  Please follow these guidelines when making changes:

- Always account for your changes in the tests, by adjusting existing tests and/or adding new tests.
- Update CHANGES.txt to account for what you changed.
- Use the same coding style as the rest of the code base.
- Run `grunt` which will lint your changes, run all tests, and integrate your changes with the combined o.js and uglified o.min.js.

## Developer Setup

In order to run the tests, minify the javascript, and/or create a custom build you'll want to install some development tools.

- node.js - If you are on a Mac you can use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install this.
- Perl - The build tools require Perl to create the combined `o.js` file.
- Install the devDepencies:
 - Open up a shell and get into the directory where you have the o-js repo cloned.
 - `npm install`
 - `npm install -g grunt-cli tap`
- Make sure everything works by running `grunt`.

## Media

Currently the only branding that o.js has is the icon which is used for the site's `favicon.png` and, slightly modified, for the `apple-touch-icon.png`.

You can download a [full size PNG](http://o-js.com/icon.png) (593x593) or the [original Pixelmator image](http://o-js.com/icon.pxm).  If you're loading the Pixelmator image make sure you grab the Lato Normal 400 font over at [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato).  You can use [SkyFonts](https://skyfonts.com/) to easly install the font (its free for Google fonts).
