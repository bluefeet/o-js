== Introduction

When o.js was originally created back in 2013 things such as the native JavaScript
(ECMAScript) class declaration and super keyword did not exist, or at least were not
widely available.  o.js was created to fill this gap, to make it possible to simply
create classes, offer property validation, and code re-use via traits.  To this day
ECMAScript is still very low-level in these regards while o.js continues to be
refined, optimized, and enhanced into a highly flexible tool enabling developers
to write more organized, concise, and maintanable software.

o.js lets you treat ECMAScript in a more traditional OO mindset, but with modern
best-practices that you'd expect from other high level languages.

One of the larger benefits, as you'll find, with o.js is that the amount of code
you write will tend to be reduced while the flexibility of it will increase.  This
is especially beneficial to large projects where encapsulation and abstraction
reduces maintenance, as well as web sites where less code means less for the
browser to download.

=== Creating a Class

In o.js a class is a constructor function which creates a function for each property.
Properties under o.js are called attributes.  Where you might normally create a new class
like this:

```js
var Person = function (args) {
    this.name = args.name;
    this.age = args.age;
};
```

In o.js you'd create it like this:

```js
var Person = new o.Class({
    attributes: {
        name: {},
        age: {}
    }
});
```

Then to create an instance of the class:

```js
var dwarf = new Person({ name:'Gimli', age:139 });
```

TIP: Classes in o.js are simply a trait which is applied to a new object when the
constructor is called.

Read more about this at the link:Classes.adoc[Classes doc] and link:Traits.adco[Traits doc].

=== Defining Attributes

Each attribute can be configured using a large selection of arguments.  For example, the
`chain` argument:

```js
var Person = new o.Class({
    attributes: {
        name: { chain:true },
        age: { chain:true }
    }
});

var wizard = new Person()->name('Gandalf')->age(2019);
```

Attribute arguments which you may find the most use for are `type`, `required`,
`devoid`, and `is`.  See the full list of arguments in the
link:Attributes.adoc[Attributes doc].

=== Validating Arguments

Attributes support a `type` argument which may be set to an `o.Type` object, for
example:

```js
var Person = new o.Class({
    attributes: {
        name: { type:o.nonEmptyStrType },
        age: { type:o.positiveIntType }
    }
});
```

If an invalid value is passed for any of there arguments that an exception will
be thrown.  You can read more about the large selection of built-in types and well
as how to define you own types in the link:Types.adoc[Types doc].

=== Defining Methods

Methods and method modifiers may be installed on classes and traits:

```js
var food = new o.Trait({
    methods: {
        eat: function (person) {
            person.health( person.health() + 5 );
        }
    }
});

var Lembas = new o.Class({
    traits: [ food ],
    around: {
        eat: function (orig, person) {
            orig( person ); // Adds 5 health.
            person.morale( person.morale() + 1 );
        }
    }
});
```

Find out more about defining methods and method modifiers in the
link:Traits.adoc[Traits doc].

== Support

The best way to get support is to hop on over to the
https://gitter.im/bluefeet/o-js[o.js Gitter Channel]
and ask there.  Alternatively you can open a
https://github.com/bluefeet/o-js/issues[GitHub Issue],
or better yet fork the repo and make a pull request.

See link:#contributing[Contributing], below, for more information.

== Custom Builds

Custom builds of o.js, containing only the features you need, can be created easily by
cloning the o-js repo, getting your environment setup (see Developer Setup below), and
using the `bin/combine` tool like this:

    bin/combine --require=Type,augment

The above would include the `Type` and `augment` modules, and their dependencies.  You
could then run `grunt minify` to produce a `o.min.js` ready for your use.

Make sure that you know which version of o.js you are creating a build of.  If you've
just cloned the o-js repo then you are on the master branch with all the latest development
work, which could very well be broken.  To get yourself pointed at the latest released
code checkout the `current` branch:

    git fetch
    git checkout current
    git pull --ff-only

Then when you run `bin/combine` you'll be using the code from the latest stable release.

== The current Branch

This branch contains the latest released version, making it easier to create links to the
latest official documentation.

== Contributing

Changes to o.js must be minimal and deliberate.  Currently the focus is contradictory -
add helpful features, increase browser/platform support, and reduce the minified size.

If you've found a bug and have the tuits to fix it, then please do.  If you've got an
idea for something new and shiny then a good way to start is to first
https://github.com/bluefeet/o-js/issues[open a ticket]
and start a discussion.

The typical way to contribute changes to o.js is by forking the GitHub repository and
sending me (Aran Deltac) a pull request in GitHub.  I'll review the pull request and ask
for any changes that I think are necessary and then accept it if all is well.  Please
follow these guidelines when making changes:

- Always account for your changes in the tests, by adjusting existing tests and/or adding
  new tests.
- Update CHANGES.txt to account for what you changed.
- Use the same coding style as the rest of the code base.
- Run `grunt` which will lint your changes, run all tests, and integrate your changes with
  the combined o.js and uglified o.min.js.

== Developer Setup

In order to run the tests, minify the javascript, and/or create a custom build you'll
want to install some development tools.

- node.js - If you are on a Mac you can use http://brew.sh/[Homebrew] to install this.
- Perl - The build tools require Perl to create the combined `o.js` file.
- Install the devDepencies:
 - Open up a shell and get into the directory where you have the o-js repo cloned.
 - `npm install`
 - `npm install -g grunt-cli tap`
- Make sure everything works by running `grunt`.

== Releasing and Publishing

To make a new release:

    grunt release-patch
    # Or: release-minor, release-major

The above will run the `default` task (`lint`, `test`, `combine`, `minify`),
runs the `tag` task which updates various files to contain the new version
number, commits the changes, creates a git tag, pushes the tag up to
origin (GitHub), and updates the `current` branch.

Once a new release has been made the release needs to be deployed to NPM:

    grunt publish-npm

== Media

Currently the only branding that o.js has is the icon which is used for the site's
`favicon.png` and, slightly modified, for the `apple-touch-icon.png`.

You can download a https://o-js.com/icon.png[full size PNG] (593x593) or the
https://o-js.com/icon.pxm[original Pixelmater image].  If you're loading the
Pixelmator image make sure you grab the Lato Normal 400 font over at
http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato[Google Fonts].  You can use
https://skyfonts.com/[SkyFonts] to easly install the font (its free for Google fonts).
