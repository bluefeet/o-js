NEXT VERSION
 Global:
 - Using Grunt for build tools.

0.0.9 : 2014-02-04
 Global:
 - Migrated everything to CommonJS format modules (no more hacks for the
   web, those will be handled independently).
 - Better error messaging across the board (no more "..." errors).
 - Lots of adjustments to reduce the minified size by several kilobytes.
 - Created several utilities in the bin directory for creating combined
   and minified versions of o.js.
 - Combined o.js and minified o-min.js are now shipped within the o-js
   repository.
 Classes:
 - Renamed o.Constructor to o.Class, because that is what it is and it is
   less to type.
 Traits:
 - Added requires attribute to o.Trait so that traits can declare a
   base-line interface that they require to be installed onto an
   object.
 Types:
 - Added o.simpleObjectType for checking if an object's constructor is Object.
 - Added o.typeType, o.attributeType, o.traitType, and o.classType for validating
   and coercing o.js's built-in object types.
 - ArrayOfType and ObjectOfType now apply their inner type's coercions.
 - Greatly simplify the trait type.
 - InstanceOfType declares a coercion that will create a new instance using
   the value as arguments to the constructor.
 - Added o.positiveIntType due to this type being a common case.
 Plumbing:
 - Exposed o.ucFirst to the public.

0.0.8 : 2014-01-03
 - In addition to accepting an Array, o.DuckType now accepts an Object,
   allowing for type checking.
 - Added o.PatternType for creating types that match against a RegExp.
 - Added bower.json so that Bower has some more info about this package.
 - Attribute/Trait.install() now supports a second argument for specifying
   the value of the attribute(s).
 - The attributes attribute of Trait is now an object instead of an array.
 - Added o.local() to localize object property changes to a scope.
 - Attribute properties reader, writer, predicate, and clearer now take
   false instead of null.
 - An attribute's writer property now defaults to false to support the best
   practice of immutable objects.
 - Avoid a race condition when filters depend on other attributes being
   set during object construction.
 - Added a builder argument to o.writer and o.Attribute which provides a
   method-based alternative to devoid.
 - Constructors now get a trait applied to them that exposes a type and
   trait attribute.
 - Traits now have a type attribute which returns a Duck type that can be
   used to validate that an object exposes an interface compatible with
   the trait.

0.0.7 : 2013-06-18
 - Attributes on Traits (and Constructors) can now be pre-made o.Attribute
   objects which may be re-used.
 - Optimize some bits to produce a smaller minified output.
 - Remove o.is functions.. again, they are a nice-to-have that just bloats things.
 - Remove the special initArgs for attributes and traits in Attribute.
 - Support Travis CI.

0.0.6 : 2013-05-27
 - Merge o-types and o-attributes in to the main library.
 - New Trait and Constructor objects.
 - Redesign types so that each type is an object with coercions.
 - Migrate tests for QUnit to tap, and add many new tests.
 - Many many new tests.
 - Redesign Attribute.
 - Allow argKey to be nullable in attributes.
 - Support Type objects in o.writer.
 - Add a package.json for npm.
 - o.writer now returns the original value.
 - o.accessor returns the return value of o.writer if writing.
 - o.predicate now treats an undefined value as a lack of having.
 - Coercion now only validates against the first type, not parent types, since
   the value, before being coerced, will often times fail a parent's validation.

0.0.5 : 2013-04-14
 - Fix trailing commas in o-attribute.js breaking minification.

0.0.4 : 2013-04-14
 - Remove the option definition property.
 - Rename o.extend to o.augment.
 - Rename the default definition property to devoid.
 - Rename the extends definition property to augments.
 - Rename the isa definition property to type.
 - New primitive and object types for boolean, string, and number.
 - Added the nonEmptyString type.
 - Rename the extends type to instanceOf.
 - Added the typeOf type.
 - New arrayOf and objectOf types.
 - New attribute extention (o-attribute.js).
 - Add versions and version checking to the libraries.

0.0.3 : 2013-03-24
 - New types extension (o-types.js).

0.0.2 : 2013-03-18
 - Added o.construct.
 - o.extend now accepts a third argument to specify properties for the
   prototype.
 - Full test coverage of the Core API.
 - Fixed around to handle return values.
 - Fixed o.extend to properly inherit the parent's prototype instead of merging
   it with the child's.
 - Default isa to "object" if extends is set.

0.0.1 : 2013-03-10
 - First release!
